An app for tracking reviews of dishes at different restaurants.
Production: <https://your-netlify-domain.netlify.app>
This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

yarn, it won’t check the lockfile and so they won’t get the right versions of dependencies.

Production: <https://opinion-ate-jss.netlify.app/>
Dependencies are locked with a `yarn.lock` file, so please use `yarn` instead
of `npm` to install them.
